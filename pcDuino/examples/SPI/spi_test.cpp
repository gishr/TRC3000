spi.cpp

Example code for SPI access on the pcDuino via C++. This code *should* work
in the future, but as of release, only SPI output works. Data presented on
the MISO pin does not register with the device!

This code is beerware- if you find it useful, please buy me (or, for that
matter, any other SparkFun employee you met) a pint next time you meet us at
the local.

  // The very first thing we need to do is make sure that the pins are set
  //   to SPI mode, rather than, say, GPIO mode.
  char path[256];
  
  for (int i = 10; i<=13; i++)
  {
    // Clear the path variable...
    memset(path,0,sizeof(path));
    // ...then assemble the path variable for the current pin mode file...
    sprintf(path, "%s%s%d", GPIO_MODE_PATH, GPIO_FILENAME, i);
    // ...and create a file descriptor...
    int pinMode = open(path, O_RDWR);
    // ...which we then use to set the pin mode to SPI...
    setPinMode(pinMode, SPI);
    // ...and then, close the pinMode file.
    close(pinMode);
  }
    
  // As usual, we begin the relationship by establishing a file object which
  //   points to the SPI device.
  int spiDev = open(spi_name, O_RDWR);
  
  // We'll want to configure our SPI hardware before we do anything else. To do
  //   this, we use the ioctl() function. Calls to this function take the form
  //   of a file descriptor, a "command", and a value. The returned value is
  //   always the result of the operation; pass it a pointer to receive a value
  //   requested from the SPI peripheral.
  
  // Start by setting the mode. If we wanted to *get* the mode, we could
  //   use SPI_IOC_RD_MODE instead. In general, the "WR" can be replaced by
  //   "RD" to fetch rather than write. Also note the somewhat awkward
  //   setting a variable rather than passing the constant. *All* data sent
  //   via ioctl() must be passed by reference!
  int mode = SPI_MODE0;

  //  pcDuino, it's 12MHz.
  int maxSpeed = 0;
  ioctl(spiDev, SPI_IOC_RD_MAX_SPEED_HZ, &maxSpeed);
  printf("Max speed: %dHz\n", maxSpeed);
  
  // In rare cases, you may find that a device expects data least significant
  //   bit first; in that case, you'll need to set that up. Writing a 0
  //   indicates MSb first; anything else indicates LSb first.
  int lsb_setting = 0;
  ioctl(spiDev, SPI_IOC_WR_LSB_FIRST, &lsb_setting);
  
  // Some devices may require more than 8 bits of data per transfer word. The
  //   SPI_IOC_WR_BITS_PER_WORD command allows you to change this; the default,
  //   0, corresponds to 8 bits per word.
  int bits_per_word = 0;
  ioctl(spiDev, SPI_IOC_WR_BITS_PER_WORD, &bits_per_word);
  
  // Okay, now that we're all set up, we can start thinking about transferring
  //   data. This, too, is done through ioctl(); in this case, there's a special
  //   struct (spi_ioc_transfer) defined in spidev.h which holds the needful
  //   info for completing a transfer. Its members are:
  //    * tx_buf - a pointer to the data to be transferred
  //    * rx_buf - a pointer to storage for received data
  //    * len - length in bytes of tx and rx buffers
  //    * speed_hz - the clock speed, in Hz
  //    * delay_usecs - delay between last bit and deassertion of CS
  //    * bits_per_word - override global word length for this transfer
  //    * cs_change - strobe chip select between transfers?
  //    * pad - ??? leave it alone.
  
  // For this example, we'll be reading the address location of an ADXL362
  //   accelerometer, then writing a value to a register and reading it back.
  //   We'll do two transfers, for ease of data handling: the first will
  //   transfer the "read register" command (0x0B) and the address (0x02), the
  //   second will dump the response back into the same buffer.

// While it seems okay to only *read* the first value from the file, you
//   seemingly must write four bytes to the file to get the I/O setting to
//   work properly. This function does that.
